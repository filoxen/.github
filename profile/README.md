## Who are we?

Filoxen Labs is a group of developers, researchers, and hobbyists interested in the history of online social games, particularly Roblox. We provide hosting for related projects at [our site](https://filoxen.lol) and develop tools for doing research.

## What do you work on?

Our main focus is a Roblox game, [_Filoxen Research Facilities_](https://www.roblox.com/games/122475963333925/Filoxen-Research-Facilities), which is a 'place roulette' game, displaying games from 2006-2012 and allowing players to visit them. Additionally, we:

  - [Archive Roblox screenshots and related images with a UI to browse through them](https://filoxen.lol/ria)
  - Host an API to work with scraped data on Roblox assets from 2006-2012
  - Work to recover and restore legacy social worlds, including Roblox, web-based, and other historical games.

## Let's work!
