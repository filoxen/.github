# Filoxen Labs

## Who are we?

Filoxen Labs is a group of developers, researchers, and hobbyists interested in legacy ROBLOX. We provide hosting for projects at our site, `filoxen.lol`, and develop tools for doing legacy ROBLOX research.

## What do you work on?

Our main focus is a ROBLOX game, _Filoxen Research Facilities_, which is a 'place roulette' game, displaying games from 2006-2012 and allowing players to visit them. Additionally, we:

  - Archive ROBLOX screenshots and related images with a UI to browse through them
  - Host an API to get data on ROBLOX games from 2006-2012

## Let's work!
